# Harmoneasy - Harmony made easy, web application

HARMONEASY is an user friendly and intuitive web application finalized to the music learning growth of the harmony student.
Through the implementation of the WebMIDI API - so the possibility to improve playing and touching with hand - HARMONEASY is able to help the student who is approaching to the study of the harmony (classic or not) in many ways:
- dynamic detection of the played chord (bichord, triad, tetrachord)
- tonality detection
- detection of the classic harmony errors (hidden/parallel fifth, octaves, tritones, resolution of the leading tone and sevenths)
- for the bravest, detection of the melody errors based on the Cantus Firmus rules

Test our app at this link, we recommend using Google Chrome:
